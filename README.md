# Step 1: Firebase Setup

## Overview

In this step, we set up our application to use Google's Firebase backend. This will provide us with a database, authentication, website hosting, and more!

## Resources

For this step, you can generally follow the steps available at:

- [Google Documentation: Add Firebase to your Flutter app](https://firebase.google.com/docs/flutter/setup?platform=ios)

By the end of this step, make sure you have
- [ ] Installed your preferred text editor or IDE
- [ ] Installed Flutter and created a blank app
- [ ] Signed into Firebase using your Google account
- [ ] Installed the Firebase CLI
- [ ] Installed the FlutterFire CLI
- [ ] Run `flutterfire configure` to create the `firebase_options.dart` configuration file
- [ ] Run `flutter pub add firebase_core` to install the core plugin to your app
- [ ] Initialize Firebase with `DefaultFirebaseOptions` in `main.dart`
