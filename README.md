# Step 8: Bottom Navigation Bar

## Overview

Once again, this step is a pretty straightforward implementation of a built-in Flutter widget: BottomNavigationBar. In order to do so, we create a Home widget with a BottomNavigationBar that changes which page the Home widget displays as the body of its Scaffold.

## Resources

This implementation follows the [official docs](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/BottomNavigationBar-class.html) fairly closely, so that is probably the best place to look!
