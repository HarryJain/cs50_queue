# Step 3: Queue Models

## Overview
In this step, we create models for our database data, in particular creating model objects for a Queue and a QueueEntry, including all the data necessary for both collections in our database. 

## Reference

In this step, we primarily based our models based on [Peter Coding's tutorial](https://petercoding.com/firebase/2022/02/16/how-to-model-your-firebase-data-class-in-flutter/). Additionally, it may be useful to check out these general resources on NoSQL databases (like Cloud Firestore) and object-oriented programming (the paradigm under which we design database models):
