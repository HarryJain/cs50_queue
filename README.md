# Step 2: App Scaffold

## Overview

This step focuses on the actual structure of the app, implementing a `Scaffold` widget which includes
- An `AppBar` with the title of the app
- A `FloatingActionButton` with a plus sign that will be used to join the queue

## Resources

For this step, it will be useful to understand the basic idea of a Flutter widget, as explained in the following resources:
- [Flutter docs](https://docs.flutter.dev/development/ui/widgets-intro)
- [The Google YouTube channel](https://youtu.be/W1pNjxmNHNQ)
- [The Net Ninja video](https://youtu.be/C5lpPjoivaw)

Additionally, you can check out the [Scaffold class documentation](https://api.flutter.dev/flutter/material/Scaffold-class.html) for specific information and customization options.

## Objectives
By the end of this step, make sure you have
- [ ] Created the `QueuePage` StatelessWidget with a `Scaffold`
- [ ] Set the `appBar` property of the `Scaffold` to an `AppBar` with a title
- [ ] Set the `floatingActionButton` property of the `Scaffold` to a `FloatingActionButton` for joining the queue
