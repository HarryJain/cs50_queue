# Flutter Workshop 1: CS50 Queue

## Overview
This GitHub repository includes the code to create a CS50 queue app using Flutter, intended as an example for the Final Project workshops. It breaks down the code into steps, each included in their own branch (which can be toggled with the button in the top left). In particular, it includes the following steps:
1. Setting up a Firebase backend for the Firestore database and authentication
2. Creating a basic Flutter app Scaffold
3. Making model objects for interacting with the database
4. Writing a DatabaseService object to interact with the database
5. Create a form for users to join the queue
6. Display the current queue members in a list view
7. Organize widgets into separate files
8. Create a bottom navigation bar with multiple pages
9. Make an Add Queue page to create new queues
10. Create tabs to show each of the individual queues
11. Add authentication with sign-in and register (can be done any time after step 1)
12. Make a profile page for checking the authentication status.

Each of these steps will have their own README.md file with additional resources and links to help you along. Moreover, the first few steps will be included in the in-person workshop before the CS50 hackathon! There is no need to understand or follow everything, but hopefully this contains enough reference for you to create the app of your dreams!
