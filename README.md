# Step 7: Widgets Organization

## Overview
This step is relatively straightforward. We merely divide up our widgets into individual files and folders.

## Resources
No real resources here, but the chosen organization is again similar to [The Net Ninja Flutter & Firebase tutorial](https://github.com/iamshaunjp/flutter-firebase/tree/lesson-27/brew_crew/lib).

## Objectives
By the end of this step, make sure you have
- [ ] Created the `widgets` subfolder of `lib` to contain all your widget files
- [ ] Copied your `JoinQueueForm`, `QueueCard`, and `QueuePage` widgets into `join_queue_form.dart`, `queue_card.dart`, and `queue_page.dart` files
- [ ] Imported `queue_page.dart` into `main.dart` and `join_queue_form.dart` and `queue_card.dart` into `queue_page.dart` so there are no import errors
